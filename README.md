# Streamify

-A dapp on the Celo blockchain that allows users to stream videos.


- In order to watch videos, users can either rent them or buy them.

- Owners recieve the funds collected from the rent.

- When someone buys a video, they will start recieving all the rent funds from that video.

- Owners can allow certain users to watch their videos for free.

- Owners can delete videos.

- Owners can edit the price for their videos.

- Users can suggest videos to other users. 

-Users can view  video suggestions from other users.


### More functionality to be implemented.

	* Disabling owners from deleting a video if one of the users is still renting it.
